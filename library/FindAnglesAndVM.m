function  [V,AccFilt,SVM,normAcc] = FindAnglesAndVM(Acc,SF,Fc)
% FindAnglesAndVM calculation of angles (6Hz low-pass filtered), vector magnitude and normalized acceleration.

% Input:
%   Acc: Acceleration [N,3]
%   SF: sample rate.
%   Fc: low-pass filter citoff

% Output:
%   V [N,3]: Inclination, forward/backward angle, sideways angle (rad).
%   AccFilt [N,3]: 2 Hz low-pass filtered acceleration.
%   SVM [N]: vector magnitude of acceleration vector (filtered).
%   normAcc [N,3]: Normalized M

% Notes:
%   Acceleration values are assumed to be caused by gravitation (quasi-stationarity).  
%   rev. 2/5-19: to handle acceleration breaks in firstbeat 'front' data
